In this project I use data produced by Skycameras of  various Maine cities to train this model on whether auroa borealis is visible in the sky. It is programmed to recieve a live feed from the cameras local to Bethel and deliver an email 
when Auroras are visible. There have been subsequent iterations of model refining with new training data created by flagging and retraining on its mistakes.
